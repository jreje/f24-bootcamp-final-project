Learn tagalog with a dictionary of words as well as flashcards. 

I used raymelon's public tagalog scraper (https://github.com/raymelon/tagalog-dictionary-scraper) and google translate API to come up with the full dictionary. Using the list of words from the provided by the scraper, I translate each word with google translate since there isn't a full dictionary I could access online with words and definitions.
